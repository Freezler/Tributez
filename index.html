            and controlled airplane flight (1903).
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wilbur-Wright">Wilbur Wright</a> (April 16, 1867, near Millville, Indiana, U.S.—May 30, 1912, Dayton, Ohio) and his brother
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Orville-Wright">Orville Wright</a> (August 19, 1871, Dayton—January 30, 1948, Dayton) also built and flew the first fully practical
            airplane (1905). Orville’s biography of Wilbur appeared in the 14th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica

            <img src="Curtiss-France.jpg" alt="Curtiss" style="width:150px;height:135px;margin-left:5px;">During this period of success for Glenn Curtiss, in 1908, the Wright Brothers saw fit to warn him not to infringe
            on their patent by either profiting from flying aircraft that used ailerons, or selling them. See, after the
            Wrights had failed to secure a patent in 1903, they hired a patent attorney who was able to secure them one in
            1904 for a ‘flying machine.’ As part of the patent, it laid claim to a new method of controlling a flying machine
            (powered or not), describing wing-warping, the Wright’s less-workable precursor to ailerons. But when other aviators
            developed and used ailerons to achieve the same control, the Wrights claimed that it was infringing on their
            patent and the methods described in it, and the US courts agreed that the Wright patent covered ailerons..</p>

      <h2>After the First Flight</h2>
      <p>The brothers made four flights in the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, and as Orville and Wilbur stood discussing
        the final flight, a sudden strong gust of wind caught hold of the aircraft and flipped it several times. The aircraft
        sustained such heavy damage to its ribs, motor and chain guides that it was beyond repair. The Wright Flyer was crated
        back to Dayton and never flew again.</p>

      <h2>Neil Armstrong carried a piece of the Wright Flyer with him to the moon.</h2>
      <p>When another aeronautical pioneer from Ohio, Neil Armstrong, became the first man to step foot on the moon in 1969,
        inside his spacesuit pocket was a piece of muslin fabric from the left wing of the original 1903 Wright Flyer along
        with a piece of wood from the airplane’s left propeller.</p>
