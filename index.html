            and controlled airplane flight (1903).
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wilbur-Wright">Wilbur Wright</a> (April 16, 1867, near Millville, Indiana, U.S.—May 30, 1912, Dayton, Ohio) and his brother
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Orville-Wright">Orville Wright</a> (August 19, 1871, Dayton—January 30, 1948, Dayton) also built and flew the first fully practical
            airplane (1905). Orville’s biography of Wilbur appeared in the 14th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica
            <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wilbur-Wright">(see the Britannica Classic: Wilbur Wright).</a>

            <img src="Curtiss-France.jpg" alt="Curtiss" style="width:150px;height:135px;margin-left:5px;">The Wrights found that Kitty Hawk had the sixth-strongest winds in the country. The area had hills to launch
            from and soft sand to land in. It was remote and not apt to draw reporters or competitors. The locals received
            them well when they arrived with a glider in 1900, Collins said. It was the ideal site to test their aircraft.
            For three years, the brothers returned to Kitty Hawk in the summer and fall to test gliders. Wilbur was so disappointed
            after their failed 1901 glider flights that he declared man would not fly for 1,000 years, Collins said. Soon
            after returning home to Ohio, Wilbur spoke publicly for the first time about his experiments at an engineers’
            convention in Chicago. He realized afterward that he and Orville knew more about flight than all of them put
            together. In late 1901, the brothers went back to their bike shop, where they ran tests on 200 tiny wings placed
            in a homemade 6-foot wind tunnel. Through the tests, the Wrights corrected math formulas for wing design used
            by contemporaries. Over the next few months, they built a new glider. The brothers returned to Kitty Hawk in
            September and with help from locals launched hundreds of flights from the top of a sand dune west of the hill
            where the imposing memorial stands now.

      <h2>After the First Flight</h2>
      <p>The brothers made four flights in the Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, and as Orville and Wilbur stood discussing
        the final flight, a sudden strong gust of wind caught hold of the aircraft and flipped it several times. The aircraft
        sustained such heavy damage to its ribs, motor and chain guides that it was beyond repair. The Wright Flyer was crated
        back to Dayton and never flew again.</p>

      <h2>Neil Armstrong</h2>
      <p>When another aeronautical pioneer from Ohio, Neil Armstrong, became the first man to step foot on the moon in 1969,
        inside his spacesuit pocket was a piece of muslin fabric from the left wing of the original 1903 Wright Flyer along
        with a piece of wood from the airplane’s left propeller.</p>
