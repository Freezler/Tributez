            <img src="abouttopcontimg.jpg" alt="wrightbrospic" style="width:150px;height:135px;margin-left:5px;">Wilbur and Orville Wright were the sons of Milton Wright, a bishop of the United Brethren in Christ. Wilbur was
            born on April 16, 1867, in Millville, Indiana. Orville was born on August 19, 1871, in Dayton, Ohio. Until the
            death of Wilbur in 1912, the two were inseparable. Their personalities were perfectly complementary (each provided
            what the other lacked). Orville was full of ideas and enthusiasms. Wilbur was more steady in his habits, more
            mature in his judgments, and more likely to see a project through. While in high school, Wilbur intended to go
            to Yale and study to be a clergyman. However, he suffered a facial injury while playing hockey, which prevented
            him from continuing his education. For the next three years he continued his education informally through reading
            in his father's large library. In their early years the two boys helped their father, who edited a journal called
            the Religious Telescope. Later, they began a paper of their own, West Side News. They went into business together
            as printers producing everything from religious handouts to commercial fliers. In 1892 they opened the Wright
            Cycle Shop in Dayton. This was the perfect occupation for the Wright brothers because it involved one of the
            exciting mechanical devices of the time: the bicycle. When the brothers took up the problems of flight, they
            had a solid grounding in practical mechanics (knowledge of how to build machines). The exploits of one of the
            great glider pilots of the late nineteenth century, Otto Lilienthal, had attracted the attention of the Wright
            brothers as early as 1891, but it was not until the death of this famous aeronautical (having to do with the
            study of flying and the design of flying machines) engineer in 1896 that the two became interested in gliding
            experiments. They then decided to educate themselves in the theory and state of the art of flying.

            <img src="firstflight.jpg" alt="wrightbrospic" style="width:150px;height:135px;margin-left:5px;"> In camp at Kill Devil Hills, they endured weeks of delays caused by broken propeller shafts during engine tests.
            After the shafts were replaced (requiring two trips back to Dayton), Wilbur won a coin toss and made a three-second
            flight attempt on December 14, 1903, stalling after takeoff and causing minor damage to the Flyer. (Because December
            13, 1903, was a Sunday, the brothers did not make any attempts that day, even though the weather was good, so
            their first powered test flight happened on the 121st anniversary of the first test flight that the Montgolfier
            brothers had done, on December 14, 1782.) In a message to their family, Wilbur referred to the trial as having
            "only partial success", stating "the power is ample, and but for a trifling error due to lack of experience with
            this machine and this method of starting, the machine would undoubtedly have flown beautifully."[75] Following
            repairs, the Wrights finally took to the air on December 17, 1903, making two flights each from level ground
            into a freezing headwind gusting to 27 miles per hour (43 km/h). The first flight, by Orville at 10:35 am, of
            120 feet (37 m) in 12 seconds, at a speed of only 6.8 miles per hour (10.9 km/h) over the ground, was recorded
            in a famous photograph.[41] The next two flights covered approximately 175 and 200 feet (53 and 61 m), by Wilbur
            and Orville respectively. Their altitude was about 10 feet (3.0 m) above the ground</p>
